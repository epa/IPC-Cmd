  to the 2-arg form of open. This to avoid errors as seen
  in this report:

Changes for 0.29_01 Thu Oct  5 16:34:44 CEST 2006
=================================================
* Rework IPC::Cmd heavily to work better on win32
* Add $WARN as global variable
* Pass parents STDOUT/STDERR to IPC::Open3 to attach STDOUT/STDERR to
  the current tty. This doesn't support capturing buffers, but there
  seems no way to do this, without using Win32::* modules.
